title: Miscellaneous Monday

A small collection of items that on their own aren't really a post but together they suffice for one. 

* I really, really hope that Rod Rosenstein isn't fired, and that whoever does replace him allows the Mueller investigation to go forward unabated. 
* Kavanaugh has always been garbage. A second accusation is not only not surprising but hopefully too burdensome to allow his confirmation to get through. I Believe Survivors. 
* One of the things I'm looking forward to in the near future is just saying no to a whole lot more shit. 
* I got word of something that I will end up complying with but really think is a step backwards for the org it pertains to. Policy decisions that come down like dictums rarely sit well with me, especially ones that put more onus on the front lines. 
*  I can't tell you enough how useful following instructions can be.  God Damn if so many of my regrets in life aren't the wasted efforts of trying to do things "my way" instead of following someone else's idea. 
*  I have to remind myself that even though it feels like no matter what I do, things never change, that they do in fact change over time and that I just need to keep swimming. 
*  Its better to be happier most of the time than it is to be right.  
*  But when it is important to be right, it's unacceptable to settle for being happy.
