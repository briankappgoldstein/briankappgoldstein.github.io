title: October Training Plan
---

It's been a wild emotional and physical ride, mi amigos.  And while doing some track and field inspired work was a good break for mind, body and soul, the fact remains that while technically "available" the facilities in my back yard are lacking in both barbells and welcome. 

But, thankfully, we've signed up as a family at the YMCA.  The facilities are basic but clean and welcoming. It's not clear if I'm able to deadlift on the premise, but it's also true I'm not going to be competing anytime soon. 

I'm not even sure how much I weigh (although one guesses it's lighter than before, judging by the way clothes are fitting).

October I'll be playing flag football for the Seminary team. Practices are on Friday afternoons, and the competition (The Luther Bowl) is on Saturday October 27. 

My "plan" is simple. I'm going to lift on Mondays and Wednesdays and Row on Tuesday and Thursdays. 
The lifting will be low to moderate intensity with moderate to high volume - something like 8 reps for 4 sets for the big lifts, and some variety provided by all the new toys I have available. No set will be taken to failure, aiming for 2-3 reps in reserve at most intense. Rest periods will be short by powerlifting standards - 2-3 minutes  - to allow for a lot of volume.  Both days will train the entire body; likely starting with the squat or deadlift, then the press or bench press, then additional work to round things out: split squats, rows, back extensions, arm and ab work. 

The rowing will be very simple too: 60 minutes at a steady state.  Get in, get the meters, get out. 

I'm focusing on rowing for several reasons: I enjoy it, it's reasonably low impact, and it's easy to quantify in a non-stupid way. 

Since it doesn't look like powerlifting is in the cards for the foreseeable future, I want to knock off a few Rowing goals. 

60 minutes: >15000m
10k : under 40 minutes
5k: under 18 minutes
2k: under 7 minutes
500m: under 1 minute, 30 seconds.  

November I'll start to get more specific toward these goals. By far the easiest one to improve is the 60 minute row. 

One thing I'll continue for October is a small home workout watching sports on saturdays. 

Basically, it's 20-30 seconds work and 30-40 seconds rest for a half hour, rotating a wide variety of calishtenics exercises. It's great for recovery and looks a lot like the general strength and abs featured here:

as an aside - simpler versions of most of the other movements shown in that video are ideal for a "general fitness" go to. 

As I have no plans on rowing competitively, once I achieve these goals, I'll go back to doing more "general" work like this.
