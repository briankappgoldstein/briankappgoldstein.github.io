## I try to read a lot and I think everyone should read more

Including, and especially me. 

Right now, I'm working through _Friday Night Lights_ by Buzz Bissinger for the Right Time Book Club. I've read it before, like a dozen years ago, and 10 or so chapters into it, the book is shocking in how **little** has changed since 1988. 

The Book Club reads 4 chapters a month, so I just read a chapter a week on that. 

The other book I'm reading right now is _Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix_, by J.K. Rowling. My wife is an enormous HP fan, and I have to admit I did not give that much respect when we met. About 2 years ago, she called me out on that, and I've been (slowly) working my way through the series. I had read the first two books as a child, but lost interest - I was just a few years too old for it to resonate the same way. But books 3,4, and 5 have, so far, been incredibly rewarding reads. I've also really enjoyed listening to the podcast [Harry Potter and the Sacred Text](http://www.harrypottersacredtext.com/). 

I have a bunch of books in my "anti-library", the books I haven't read yet. I'm trying to be more dilligent about tracking progress and wish list on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6465572-brian) . 

I also went on a book moratorium until we moved, so my [Amazon](http://a.co/51cmSUt) wishlist is bloated beyond belief.
