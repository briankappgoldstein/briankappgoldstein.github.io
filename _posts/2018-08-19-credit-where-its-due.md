Back in early February, my friend Mary Jo killed her family and her self and it was horrible and sad and terrifying and an occasion to hold one another close and thank g-d it wasn't our family. 

So imagine my surprise when MJ's instagram account posted a link in bio promotional photo. I immediately reported it and in a few hours the Facebook communications team took action to memorialize the account and remove that content. 

They might get a lot of things wrong, but on this one small act of decency, I'm thankful they were there to do something right. 

Also, today is the 6th anniversary of our adoption of our beloved cat, Tigger Masala Barry-Goldstein. Mock me for being a crazy cat dad if you like, but he's as trusty a friend and as warm as compainion as I've known in my life. My life is so much better because of him.
