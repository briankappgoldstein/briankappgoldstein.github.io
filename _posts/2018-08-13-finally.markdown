Oy vey with the poodles already. 

It's been nearly 2 years since I've done an overhaul of my personal site. A lot has happened since then, namely, we've had a kid and moved cross country! 

It was time for a change, and after having gone around and around on different iterations, just time to get *something* up. This new site is on Jekyll (for now), and uses the Minima default theme (again, for now). I chose Jekyll because it's fast to get up and running and because GH pages is free. 

I strongly urge you to subscribe via RSS, because I do plan on posting pretty frequently.
