title: Three Free Rowing Programs
---

I really enjoy using the Concept 2 Indoor Rowing Ergometer, and I think you might too. 

I put together three free programs for you to use as you see fit, since the new Ranking Season started on May 1. 

If you download any of these and use, send me an email with your results!

[5000m Rowing Plan](/5000m%20Row%20Plan.pdf) ---> this is the one I'm running this summer, if you want to follow along.
