Little Irony #1 - being stuck inside all day with a sick toddler should be miserable, right? I'm actually having a really nice day with my son. He's very clingy today but that's alright. It's lots of snuggles and when he's not crying he's quite pleasant, so, it's a nice way to spend a reflective Rosh Hashanah. 

#2 - I tend to not to enjoy a lot of rewritten liturgical texts. They very often read touchy-feely or divorced from the purpose of the service; performative acts of self righteousness.  But the latest URJ machzurim for the high holidays are outstanding, and I found myself last night pouring over the selected readings and footnotes.  I'll share some of my favorites over the next few days. 

#3 - Whenever I don't post for a few days, you might think it's because I don't have anything to say. The irony is that is usually when I have the most I want to say, but life does happen and get in the way. I just finished reading "Between the World and Me" by Ta-Nehisi Coates and predictably, loved it, as well as just having my normal every day thoughts. Oh, and I am almost down with the JavaScript Course, but I need to do a few more things first.
