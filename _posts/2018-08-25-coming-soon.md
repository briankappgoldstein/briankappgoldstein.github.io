title: "Coming soon"
---

Here's some of the stuff that's coming soon in this space. 
- essays; I have a few brewing now
- finishing up JS Fundamentals and onto a project using a framework (TBD)
- the Top 10 TWW episodes listicle
- cooking and meal planning tutorials
- Open question but I love to talk performance training, fitness, and want to know if y'all want that meat head stuff or not?
- I will start to build a tribute site to the GOAT: *The Wire*
- Obviously the work section will get fleshed out more, as well. I plan to add 1 a month through the end of the year, so 4 by 2019. 
- and more.
