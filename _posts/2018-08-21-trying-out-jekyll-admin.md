title: Trying out Jekyll Admin
---

I have to say, this is pretty swanky!

basically you fire it up via the command line `bundle exec jekyll serve` and then go to `localhost:4000/admin`.

Super easy and you get a slick WYWIWYG post editor to use.  Still need to figure out how best to set up images for everything.
