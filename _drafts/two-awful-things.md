There's a thread of revulsion against our current President that bothers me everytime I see it. It goes something like "This is an aberation, and voting him out of office will go a long way to fixing it."

Sadly, no, that's not correct. Let's start with what is correct about it, or at least implied by it: that Trump is *uniquely* corrosive to the American body politic. Which is largely true; I think the only analogue that approaches this moment is the Democratic Party led by Andrew Jackson, which was functionally a personality cult led by an autocrat with disastorous economic literacy - The depression of the 1830's, caused by his policies, precipitated malnourishment that lowered the national average height by several inches in the 1840s and 1850s. 

I don't think the tariffs will get us there; only to illustrate that this is a dangerous presidency, and the sooner it ends, the better off all Americans (and indeed, the world) will be. 

However, the sentiment that bothers me is that the forces that propelled this embarassment into the Oval Office will be beaten back by merely an electoral rebuff is naive at best. Trump and Trumpism is not an aberation: it's a thread older than the republic it infects. The history is there, not buried but simply ignored or in many cases whitewashed for the benefit of white liberals like me. 

I'm not saying you need to feel guilt about it; it doesn't do much good. I am not suggesting ambivalence or ennui, either. I am suggesting that as a good American citizen you learn and grapple with it. 

And you should absolutely vote out every single one of these bastards this fall and in 2020. Elections might not erase movements, but they do have a way of helping end them.
