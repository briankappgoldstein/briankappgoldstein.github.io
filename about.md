Hi!

My name is Brian Goldstein. I am a Senior Digital Strategist at U.Group, and also an iMSA student at the University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign. My family and I currently reside in Alexandria, VA.

In my spare time (of which there's precious little) I like to spend it playing with my family and cat, reading, cooking, or exercising. I'm also proudly Jewish and try to spend some time on that each day.
