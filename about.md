Hi!

My name is Brian Goldstein. I am now an SEO expert with a digital marketing firm in St. Louis. I am also completing my Master's degree in Accountancy from the University of Illinois. 

In my spare time I like to spend it playing with my family and cat, reading, cooking, or exercising. I'm also proudly Jewish and try to spend some time on that each day.
