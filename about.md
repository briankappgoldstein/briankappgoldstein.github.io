Hi there!

My name is Brian Goldstein. I'm employed as a Front End Developer at [Spry Digital](https://sprydigital.com/ "Spry Digital"), but as the Cat in the Hat is fond of saying, that is not all I can do, and so, this site is about all the other good tricks that I know. 

I plan on a more daily, less formal, format for posts. I want to record all of the things that I'm doing. I always feel like I have a million projects going on, and so I want to not only get a better handle on that but to show off, frankly, how I write and think and solve problems. I've found that good things come from honesty, and moreso from being forthcoming with that truth.  

By subscribing via RSS you'll be able to follow along; I'm not promoting on social media and I'm not making a freakin' email newsletter. I will be putting whatever code I generate up on the usual suspects: CodePen, GitHub, Netlify, etc. 

I'm going to try very, very hard to use this site to break the perfectionist streak in me, the one that says if something isn't perfect, it isn't worth doing. The reality is that we all are learning by doing, and the doing is the key to getting better. 

### Personal Details 

+ DOB: September 27, 1984
+ Hometown: St. Louis, MO
+ Currently: Alexandria, VA
+ Married to Meg, Father to Felix, High Priest to my Cat, Tigger
+ Hobbies - I love to cook! I also try to read widely as interests me, and I have competed in a powerlifting meet (and want to continue)
+ What am I like? 
	+ MBTI: ENFP
	+ Pottermore: Hufflepuff (though my wife insists I'm actually Slytherin).
	+ OCEAN Big 5: High degrees in Openness, Conscientiousness, and Neuroticism. Average extraversion and agreeableness.
	+ "Cat Software in Dog Hardware" 
	+ "Cheerleader/Coach, helps others see what's good in them"
	+ If you're in, you're in. I tend to make fewer, deeper friendships and maintain them over time and distance well. 
+ Peeves:
	+ Language Abuse, especially the Passive Voice, because it passes off responsibility.
	+ Unwitting Racism and Misogyny (the knowing kind bother me too, to be clear)
	+ Little things left undone (e.g. people who leave their shopping carts in the parking lot, instead of the cart returns or people who put weights back incorrectly)
	+ "The Rules don't apply to me" - yes, yes they do, person passing on the right or microwaving fish in the office. 
	+ General Carelessness. 
	+ Explanations via Hand Waving - look, you don't have to have an iron clad explanation, and sometime urgency is explanation enough, but don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining, ok?
